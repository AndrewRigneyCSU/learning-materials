# Interact2 UX Refresh

Aim

The aim of this initiative is to improve the user experience of Interact2 by updating the theme in the following ways:

- Align the aesthetic to match CSU's online systems
- Update the look of the system to reflect modern web conventions
- Take advantage of the new responsive theme in Bb Q52016 upgrade to improve access on mobile devices
- Reduce the 'clunky' nature of Interact2 by simplifying the colour palette used throughout the system.
- Improve the cluttered interface and reduce redundancy and duplication
- Provide a better default for content in Blackboard and provide extra pedagogically driven layout and styling options
- Improve readability of content within Blackboard and printing capabilities

The initiative will also look to develop the following:

- A library of HTML elements that can be reused by staff to improve the functionality in Blackboard
- A set of CSS classes that can be called throughout the system to create unique and specific content elements
- A simple colour palette to use throughout content to provide visual cues to improve learning
- Integrate components of Material Design to define elements on the page and create an identifiable hierarchy.

## Changes

**New Font** - Use of Source Sans Pro as the font for Interact2. This is the closest choice in open fonts to CSU's official Helvetica. The font, developed by Adobe, is open and can be downloaded to linked to using Google Fonts and comes in a variety of weights. It also has an accompanying Serif option which may be useful. The font choice will help to provide a more coherent and consistent look across operating systems, browsers and devices.

**Colour Palette** - The main interface of the Blackboard has been simplified to white and grey hues with Inline links being in blue. The reduction in Red as the dominant colour provides more white space creates and a more simple, appealing and decluttered interface. An expanded colour palette will be used within the *Content Frame* to provide more visual cues and definitions throughout the content.

**Clean up Dashboard Modules** - The Dashboard is the default landing page for Interact2 and has much influence on overall perceptions of the system. At present it is a mish-mash of various modules and links to other services, sections and content within the CSU environment. This area hasn't been updated for quite some time and since it's implementation various new services such as the Student and Staff Portals have come online. Therefore the new theme provides an opportunity to clean up this area and remove redundant links and content that is available in other areas. The aim is to focus Interact2 on it's role as the *Learning Environment* rather than an additional portal replicating links. This result of this clean up will be a decluttered and much cleaner landing screen for staff and students by default, with staff and students able to add to the page using the Customisation options.

#### Limitations

- There is a current limitation on theming the MyBlackboard pages that are accessed from the User icon in the global navigation bar. At present these are styled as part of a building block rather than the Theme files.
