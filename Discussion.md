- [ ] Dashboard Modules
    - Too many? Do we need to rationalise?
    - Display things differently?
- [ ] Icons vs Labels
  - Would it be more useful to look at developing a style to label learning activities rather than use generic icon sets?
  - Wondering about "learning activities" and if these are adequately visualised using current or available icon sets.
  - Would a style to identify and label activities be better?
  - Icon libraries - [Material](https://material.io/icons/), [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [ ] Cards, Tiles and Panels - Creating Visual Hierarchies
  - **Tiles** display an individual content group, usually visual - eg image + text,
  - A **Card** is a collection of content & action items within a section - eg. image + heading + text + action
  - **Panels** are backgrounds to create visual separation of sections
  - Material Design talks about "Sheets" - better metaphor than panels? Or sheets as in the background of the "page"?
- [ ] Grids and Measurements?
  - Use of the [8 Point Grid](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632) to define sizes
  - Use of Flexbox to keep flow of items & some responsiveness
    - Use flex on a div and then define item width by class
