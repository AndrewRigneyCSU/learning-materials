#### Move to Phase 2

- [ ] Aside & Marginalia - for related information, notes or additional info

- [ ] Tabs to show examples, answers & feedback
- [ ] Modal Dialogue - to provide answers or explanations

#### Dashboard Layout
- [ ] Need data on usage
- [ ] Need to do user testing
- [ ] Explore use of Institutional Roles
  - Can be used to expose different modules
  - Might be useful for EDs - big course/subject lists as different module
  - Potential for having different UI for Staff and Students
- [ ] Declutter modules on home page
    - Remove everything except course & orgs by default
    - **add video to introduce new Inteact2 theme on Dashboard?**  
    - keep customisation on so students can add and remove as they like
    - staff - use settings to turn on staff links too

#### Out of Scope

- [ ] Explore modifying Course list to get "Tile View"
  - To get tiles style interface we need subject code and name separated.
  - Needs to be done at the building block level
- [ ] Styling for MyBb areas
   - styles are loaded within Bb app  - then into iFrame.
   - Theme can't be applied to iFrame
