The new styles rely on semantic markup to be used. This means utilising exiting HTML tags ```<h1>```, ```<h2>```,```<h3>```,```<h4>```,```<h5>```, ```<h6>``` and ```<p>``` should be used to appropriately markup text on the screen.

Headings are usually bold but to ```H3``` and ```H5``` are not and provide a good way to visually break up text.

In addition to headings a number of other HTML tags have been styled:

- [[Lists]]
- [[Blockquotes]]
- [[Citations]]
- [[APA References]]

A number of modifier have been created to apply underlines, colours, weight and size variations.

These include:

- Colour - add class from the [[Colours]] list
- Underline - add ```underline``` class
- To colour Underline - add class from the [[Colours|Line Colours]] list
- UPPERCASE TRANSFORM - add ```uppercase``` class
- Capitalise Transform - add ```capitalise``` class
- lowercase transform - add ```lowercase``` class
- small text transform - add ```small-text``` class
- smaller text transform - add ```smaller-text``` class
- heavy text transform - add ```heavy-text``` class
- light text transform - add ```light-text``` class
- indent applied - add ```indent``` class
