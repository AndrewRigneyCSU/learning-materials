Lists are usually ordered ```<ol>``` or unordered ```<ul>``` and include list items ```<li>```.

Normal lists would look like the following:


```html
<ol>
    <li>Item one</li>
    <li>Item two</li>
    <li>Item three</li>
    <li>Item four</li>
</ol>
```

OR

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item one</li>
    <li>Item two</li>
    <li>Item three</li>
    <li>Item four</li>
</ul>
```

## Modifiers

These basic lists can be modified to produce "fancylists" - items that use the structure of a list to display content in a different way. These include:

- **Step Lists** - adds the word ```STEP``` before each item in an ordered list with the ```step-list``` class
- **Fancy Numbers** - adds a coloured square behind the number of each item in an ordered list with the ```fancy-numbers``` class
- **Time Lines** - creates a timeline effect to an unordered list with the class ```timeline``` added. Headings ```H2``` and ```H3``` can be used to differentiate text, say for dates, in the timeline.

Fancy Lists can be coloured using the ```fancylist-xxxx``` class and using the [[Colours]] list to specify the correct colour.
